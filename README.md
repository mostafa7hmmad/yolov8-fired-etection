# 🔥 Fire and Smoke Detection with YOLOv8

Fire and smoke detection is critical for early warning systems in wildfire monitoring and safety applications. This project implements a deep learning solution using the *YOLOv8s* model from Ultralytics for accurate and real-time detection of fire and smoke in images. The model is trained on a *custom dataset* and evaluated using various performance metrics to ensure real-world applicability.

---

## 🛠 Preprocessing Steps

* *Image Scanning*: Training and validation datasets are scanned for images and labels.
* *Corrupt Image Handling*: 21 corrupt training images and 5 corrupt validation images are ignored.
* *Normalization: All images are resized to **640x640* pixels for YOLOv8 compatibility.
* *Dataset Configuration*: A data.yaml file defines image paths and class labels (fire, smoke).

---

## 🔀 Data Splitting

* *Training Set*: 14,101 images (after removing corrupt files)
* *Validation Set*: 3,094 images (after removing corrupt files)
* *No Test Split*: Model evaluation is done on the validation set.

## 🔄 Data Augmentation

To enhance model generalization and robustness:

### Training Set:

* Mosaic (80% probability)
* Random Rotation (±10°)
* Horizontal Flip (50%)
* HSV Adjustments:

  * Hue: 0.015
  * Saturation: 0.7
  * Value: 0.4
* Random Scale: 0.7
* Shear: 0.3
* Translate: 0.2
* *Albumentations*:

  * Blur
  * Median Blur
  * ToGray
  * CLAHE

### Validation Set:

* No augmentation, only normalization.
